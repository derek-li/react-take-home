## To run the app locally

First, install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Then, in the root directory run:
1. `cd app`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

### `cd app`

Switches to the project directory.

### `npm install`

Installs necessary packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Bonus

- I was able to implement the video feature allowing videos to play inline.
- I did not implement any techniques to optimize load times, but I would suggest some kind of lazy loading. Need
  to do more research.

============================================================

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I also used https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to get video data.
